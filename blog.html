                  <strong>LocalStorage Vs SesssionStorage</strong> sessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab.Local Storage: This read-only interface property provides access to the Document’s local storage object, the stored data is stored across browser sessions. Similar to sessionStorage, except that localStorage data gets cleared when the page session ends – that is when the page is closed. It is cleared when the last “private” tab of a browser is closed (localStorage data for a document loaded in a private browsing or incognito session).Session Storage objects can be accessed using the sessionStorage read-only property. The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends.

                    <strong>The Global scope</strong>

                    A variable exists inside or outside a block. If a variable is declared outside all functions or
                    curly braces ({}), it exists in the global scope. The global variables can be accessed by any
                    line of code in the program, including inside blocks. <br>
                    <strong>The Block scope</strong>

                    So far, we’ve seen variables defined with the var keyword. Var can declare a variable either in
                    the global or local scope. The variables that are declared within the block scope are comparable
                    to local ones. They are available within the block that they are defined.

                    The main difference between the local scope and block scope is that the block statements (e.g.
                    if conditions or for loops), don't create a new scope. So the var keyword will not have an
                    effect, because the variables are still in the same scope.

                    <strong>The event loop</strong> is the secret behind JavaScript’s
                    asynchronous programming. JS executes all operations on a single thread, but using a few
                    smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading. Let’s take a look at
                    what happens on the back-end.



                    The call stack is responsible for keeping track of all the operations in line to be
                    executed. Whenever a function is finished, it is popped from the stack.

                    The event queue is responsible for sending new functions to the stack for processing. It
                    follows the queue data structure to maintain the correct sequence in which all operations
                    should be sent for execution.

                    Whenever an async function is called, it is sent to a browser API. These are APIs built into
                    the browser. Based on the command received from the call stack, the API starts its own
                    single-threaded operation.

                    An example of this is the setTimeout method. When a setTimeout operation is processed in the
                    stack, it is sent to the corresponding API which waits till the specified time to send this
                    operation back in for processing.
